cybersecurity_ethical_hacking_learning
Practical cybersecurity and ethical hacking learning environment built for learning, testing, network configuration, and authorized security exercises.

Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking learning Environment
Overview
This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity and ethical hacking learning environment. It includes practical work related to virtualization, Kali Linux, networking, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, web security, and security testing.

The purpose of this lab is to develop practical cybersecurity skills in an isolated and authorized environment.

Lab Objectives
Build an isolated cybersecurity practice environment
Configure virtual machines for security testing
Install and configure Kali Linux
Configure virtual networking
Understand IP addressing and connectivity
Practice reconnaissance and enumeration
Perform vulnerability assessment in authorized labs
Study web application security
Document practical security findings
Create snapshots for safe experimentation and rollback
Lab Environment & Specifications
Virtualization
Hypervisor: Oracle VirtualBox
Host Operating System: Windows
Security Testing OS: Kali Linux
Network Type: NAT / Host-Only Network
Purpose: Isolated cybersecurity laboratory
Tools
Kali Linux
Nmap
Wireshark
Burp Suite
Metasploit Framework
Gobuster
Netcat
Python
Network Configuration
Example private laboratory network:

Machine	Example IP
Kali Linux	10.0.0.2
Target VM	10.0.0.10
Test VM	10.0.0.11
These addresses are examples for an isolated lab environment.

Phase 1 — Kali Linux Setup
Step 1: Install VirtualBox
Oracle VirtualBox was installed and configured as the virtualization platform for the cybersecurity laboratory.

Step 2: Install Kali Linux
Kali Linux was installed inside a virtual machine and configured for security testing and cybersecurity practice. Kali Linux Network Configuration

Step 3: Configure Network Connection
The virtual machine network adapter was configured using an isolated laboratory network.

NAT Network Configuration

Step 4: Verify Network Configuration
Network configuration was verified using standard Linux networking commands.

Example:

ip addr
The assigned IP address and network interface were checked to confirm that the virtual machine was connected correctly.

IP Interface Verification

Step 5: Test Connectivity
Connectivity between authorized laboratory machines was tested.

Connectivity Test

Example:

ping 10.0.0.10
The test was used to verify communication between machines inside the controlled lab environment.

Virtual Machine Snapshots
Snapshots were created after major configuration stages.

Recommended snapshots:

Fresh OS installation
Network configuration completed
Kali Linux configured
Target machine configured
Pre-testing state
Snapshots allow the laboratory environment to be restored to a known working state after experiments.

Reconnaissance & Enumeration
Authorized laboratory systems can be examined using tools such as Nmap.

Example:

nmap -sV 10.0.0.10
The purpose of this activity is to understand network discovery, service enumeration, and basic security assessment techniques.

Web Security
The laboratory can also be used to study common web application security concepts, including:

Authentication security
Input validation
SQL Injection concepts
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Access control
Security headers
All testing is performed only against intentionally vulnerable applications or systems for which authorization has been provided.

Practical Work
This repository will contain documentation, screenshots, commands, lab results, and security observations from my cybersecurity learning.

Future practical projects will be added as separate sections.

Learning Outcomes
Through this laboratory I aim to develop practical skills in:

Linux
Networking
Cybersecurity
Ethical Hacking
Vulnerability Assessment
Web Security
Network Security
Security Tools
Technical Documentation
Disclaimer
This repository is intended for educational and authorized cybersecurity testing only.

All security testing must be performed against systems, applications, networks, CTFs, or laboratories where explicit permission has been provided.

I do not support unauthorized access, disruption, data theft, or illegal activity.
